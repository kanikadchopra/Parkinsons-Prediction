# Parkinsons-Prediction

This project us to leverage speech signals to detect Parkinson's Disease using a binary logistic regression model. This involved conducting preliminary analyses and transforming the data to satisfy the assumptions of an LR model. Likelihood-ratio tests and stepwise AIC with backwards selection were used to find the optimal fit. This final model was then tested with diagnostic checks to ensure the model was a strong fit. Lastly, the model was used to predict PD on test data and evaluated for it's classification accuracy.
